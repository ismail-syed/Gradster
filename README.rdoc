Soooooooo, lol,
I had issues with applying twitter bootstrap to grade-calc for some reason so I just redesgined grade-calc from scratch since it wasn't even that far into development. 


====Updates
-Implemented Twitter bootstrap 

Issue: After adding the <em>components</em> route as a sub-resource to <em>grades</em> there was an issue with the <em>componenets</em> form.
